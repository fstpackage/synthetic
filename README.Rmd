## Overview

The `syntheticbenchmark` package provides tooling to greatly symplify benchmarking of serialization solutions such as `fst`, `arrow`, `feather`, `fread/fwrite` or `sqlite`. By using a standardized method of benchmarking, results become more reliable and more easy to compare.


## Features

Benchmarks performed With `syntheticbench` have the following features:

* Each measurement of serialization speed uses a unique dataset (_avoid disk caching_)
* A read is not executed immediately after a write of the same dataset  (_avoid disk caching_)
* All (column-) data is generated on the fly using predefined generators (_no need to download large test sets_)
* A wide range of data profiles can be used for the creation of synthetic data (_understand dependencies on data format and profile_)
* Object- en file sizes are recorded and speeds automatically calculated (_reproducible results_)
* A progress bar shows percentage done and time remaining (_know when to go and get a cup of coffee_)
* Only the actual serialization speed is benchmarked (_measure only what must be measured_)
* Multithreaded solutions are correctly measured (_unlike some benchmark techniques_)

But most importantly, with the use of `syntheticbench`, complex benchmarks are reduced to a few simple statements, increasing your productivity and reproducibility!


## Walkthrough: setting up a benchmark

A lot of claims are made on the performance of serializers and databases, but the truth is that all solutions have their own strenghts and weaknesses.

_some more text here_

Define the template of a test dataset:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(syntheticbench)
library(fst)
library(arrow)

# generator for 'fst benchmark' dataset
generator <- table_generator(
  "fst benchmark",
  function(nr_of_rows) {
    data.frame(
      Logical = sample_logical(nr_of_rows, true_false_na_ratio = c(85, 10, 5)),
      Integer = sample_integer(nr_of_rows, max_value = 100L),
      Real    = sample_integer(nr_of_rows, 1, 10000, max_distict_values = 20) / 100,
      Factor  = as.factor(sample(labels(UScitiesD), nr_of_rows, replace = TRUE))
    )}
)
```

Do some benchmarking on the _fst_ format:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

synthetic_bench() %>%
  bench_generators(generator) %>%
  bench_streamers(streamer_fst()) %>%
  bench_rows(1e7) %>%
  collect()
```

Congratulations, that's your first structured benchmark :-)

Now, let´s add a second _streamer_ and allow for two different sizes of datasets:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
synthetic_bench() %>%
  bench_generators(generator) %>%
  bench_streamers(streamer_fst(), streamer_parguet()) %>%  # two streamers
  bench_rows(1e7, 5e7) %>%
  collect()
```

As you can see, although benchmarking two solutions at different sizes is more complex than the single solution benchmark, with `syntheticbench` it´s just a matter of expanding some of the arguments.

Let´s add two more _streamers_ and add compression settings to the mix:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
synthetic_bench() %>%
  bench_generators(generator) %>%
  bench_streamers(streamer_rds(), streamer_fst(), streamer_parguet(), streamer_feather()) %>%
  bench_rows(1e7, 5e7) %>%
  bench_compression(50, 80) %>%
  collect()
```
